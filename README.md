KST API Development Test, A restaurant client requested an API where they can easily manage their food menu. The API should be able to categorize the food menu (e.g. Bakmi Ayam and Mie Goreng Telur are in Noodles Category and Orange Juice and Sweetened Tea are in Drinks Category). The API should also be able to GET all the available menu and the details of a menu, CREATE new menu, UPDATE existing menu, and DELETE unneeded menu.
